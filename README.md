PCB Defect Detection

A PCB defect detection application deployed using the QT and OnnxRuntime framework.

* Use C++ for deep learning model deployment.
* Use QT for application development.
* Model deployment is implemented using the OnnxRuntime framework.
* We use PKU-Market-PCB datasets.

## Install

* clone the project by ```git clone https://github.com/StudentKang/Easy_PCB_App.git```
